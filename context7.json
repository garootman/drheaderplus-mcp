  "description": "MCP server that audits HTTP security headers from AI assistants. Scans URLs or analyzes raw headers against OWASP, CSP, HSTS, cookie flags, and CORS best practices.",

  "excludeFiles": ["CLAUDE.md", "CHANGELOG.md", "LICENSE"],
  "rules": [
    "scan_url requires a full URL with scheme (e.g. https://example.com), not just a domain name.",
    "Use analyze_headers instead of scan_url when you already have the HTTP response headers to avoid an extra network call.",
    "Use list_presets to discover available rulesets before passing a preset name to scan_url or analyze_headers.",
    "The owasp-asvs-v14 preset enforces strict OWASP ASVS 4.0 V14 compliance and will flag more issues than the default ruleset.",
    "Set cross_origin_isolated=true only when auditing sites that require Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy and Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy headers.",
    "scan_bulk handles individual URL failures gracefully — a failing URL returns an error message without stopping the entire batch.",
    "Each finding dict contains rule, severity, message, and value fields. Use severity to prioritize fixes (high > medium > low).",
    "Install with uvx for zero-config usage: uvx drheaderplus-mcp. No pip install needed.",
    "The server uses stdio transport. Configure it in Claude Desktop, Claude Code, or VS Code via their MCP server settings.",
    "See the security headers guide for how to fix each finding with nginx, Apache, Node.js/Express, or Cloudflare config snippets.",
    "Use analyze_headers in CI/CD pipelines to validate header configuration before deployment without making network requests."
